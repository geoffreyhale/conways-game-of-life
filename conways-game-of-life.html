<h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
<p>This is a zero-player cellular automation.

<br/>No further input is required.</p>

<h2>Rules:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>
